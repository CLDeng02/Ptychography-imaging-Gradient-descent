# Ptychography-imaging-Gradient-descent
Recovering the amplitude and phase information of a sample from ptychographic diffraction data using the gradient descent method.
- **amplitude_Gd ：** The file "amplitude_Gd" is designed to recover the amplitude distribution that can diffract into a target image using the gradient descent method when the target image is provided.
- **ptych_Gd ：** The file "ptych_Gd" is a complete simulation program that applies the gradient descent method to ptychography.
